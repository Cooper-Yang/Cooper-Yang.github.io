        <p>Inspired by Chinese Taoist Excosim, Epitaph 1997 is a blend of Eastern Horror and thrilling combat. The protagonist is a police detective as well as a Taoist priest. Utilize both crime knowledge and Taoist craft to solve the mystery and exorcise the ghost.</p>
        <p> I coordinated the internal communication of the game design team. This is a WIP project for Capstone at NYU Game Center.</p>

        <p>“The Judge” is a puzzle-solving interactive novel game, that takes place in the late 1980s fictional dystopian country “The New Republic of Chiu”. Play as the government employed investigator Yao Bang working for the “Committee of Justice” to solve a series of various cases, and discover the truth about this tyrannical society.</p>
        <p>  We focused on digging the narration and puzzles of the game. We redesigned the in-game computer system and made the puzzle more diegetic and intuitive. Further, we created real time progression to facilitate an immersive player experience.</p>

        <p>This is a clone of the first level of the famous game, Doom (1993) by id Software. They developed it over seven* weeks while maintaining their other academic obligations. This clone includes the first level of Doom, including all the secrets, minus the textures in the final room.</p>
        <p> All assets were made by the students and they have attempted to show this by having them be as close to the original textures, sounds, and code as possible while not taking it from its source. Their goal was to evoke the feeling of the original game, for it to be recognizable, while not the exact same thing so they can show off their creative roundabout abilities and learn development techniques as they progress in the project. I focused on implementing the player controller and pixelation shader.</p>
