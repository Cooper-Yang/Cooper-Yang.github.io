        <p>Hello Neuromancer,</p>
        <p>I am Cooper and currently a senior student majoring in NYU Game Design. Generally, I am a player and a game designer.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about games and a fast learner and also a team worker. As a game designer, I know the harsh process and iteration during game development. The group project and the solo project over four years gave me some experience: game design in conceptual and practical ways, prototyping, debugging, team working, and even the ability to pitch my game. </p>
        <p>Please contact me directly through email for a full cv. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
